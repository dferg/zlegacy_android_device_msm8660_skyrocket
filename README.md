----------------------
This repository is an attempt to collaboratively build up an Android device tree for the AT&T Samsung Galaxy S II Skyrocket.

It is derived from the Code Aurora project's msm8660_surf device tree.  See: https://www.codeaurora.org/xwiki/bin/QAEP

Use the gingerbread_house branch with the M8260AAABQNLZA307007.xml manifest.
